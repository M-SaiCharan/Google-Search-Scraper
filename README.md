## Limitations
- **Dynamic Content**: Googleâ€™s structure may change over time, potentially breaking the script. If this happens, inspect the page elements and update the CSS selectors in the script.
- **No Official API**: This script does not use the official [Google Custom Search JSON API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction). Use at your own discretion.
